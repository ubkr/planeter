# Planetvis (Planeter) — Implementation Plan

## Overview

A web application that calculates which planets are visible from a specific location (primarily Sweden) at a given time. Reuses architecture, patterns, and components from the sibling `norrsken` (aurora visibility) project. Backend: Python FastAPI with the `ephem` library for astronomical calculations. Frontend: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Leaflet map picker.

## MVP Scope

The MVP answers one question: **"Which planets can I see from my location right now, and where do I look?"**

### MVP Features

1. Calculate positions (altitude, azimuth) of all naked-eye planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) for a given location and time
2. Determine rise/set times for each planet
3. Assess actual visibility considering: altitude above horizon, sun position (daylight penalty), cloud cover, planet apparent magnitude
4. Display results in a dark-themed UI showing each planet's status, direction, and visibility score
5. Location picker with map (reused from norrsken)
6. Weather/cloud cover integration (reused from norrsken)

## Phase-by-Phase Execution

## Phase 1: Project Setup — ✅

**Depends on**: none
**Parallelisable with**: none

### Tasks
- ✅ Already in place — directory structure created: `backend/app/`, `backend/app/api/routes/`, `backend/app/models/`, `backend/app/services/planets/`, `backend/app/utils/`, `frontend/js/components/`, `frontend/css/components/`
- ✅ Already in place — all `__init__.py` files created in every Python package directory
- ✅ Already in place — `backend/requirements.txt` copied from norrsken; removed `apscheduler` and `aiofiles`
- ✅ Already in place — `backend/app/config.py` adapted: title "Planeter API", description "Planet visibility calculations for Sweden", removed aurora-specific fields, added `openmeteo_base_url`
- ✅ Already in place — `backend/app/main.py` adapted: aurora/prediction/weather routers removed, health and geocode registered, TODO stub for planets router
- ✅ Already in place — `start-backend.sh` copied and paths updated to planeter
- Copy `start-frontend.sh` from norrsken — update paths to planeter frontend directory (norrsken has no `start-frontend.sh`; create in Phase 6 alongside `index.html`)
- ✅ Already in place — `.env` and `.env.example` created with placeholder values

### Intended Outcome
The project directory exists in its final shape. The backend starts (uvicorn) and responds to requests; the health endpoint returns 200. No planet logic is wired yet.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All package directories exist and contain `__init__.py`
- [ ] `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt` completes without errors
- [ ] `start-backend.sh` starts uvicorn without import errors
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/health` returns HTTP 200 with a valid JSON body
- [ ] `backend/app/config.py` loads from `.env` without validation errors

---

## Phase 2: Planet Calculation Engine — ✅

**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Parallelisable with**: Phase 3

### Tasks
- Build `backend/app/models/planet.py` — Pydantic models `PlanetPosition` and `PlanetData` covering altitude, azimuth, magnitude, constellation, rise/transit/set times
- Build `backend/app/services/planets/calculator.py` — implement `calculate_planet_positions(lat, lon, dt) -> list[PlanetPosition]` using `ephem`
- Compute per-planet fields for Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn: altitude (degrees), azimuth (degrees), apparent magnitude, constellation name, rise time, transit time, set time
- Handle circumpolar and never-rises edge cases (rise/set can be None)

### Intended Outcome
A single function call with a latitude, longitude, and datetime returns a fully populated list of `PlanetPosition` objects for all five naked-eye planets, computed via `ephem`.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] `ephem` returns a non-zero altitude for Jupiter on 2025-06-15 00:00 UTC at lat=55.7, lon=13.4
- [ ] All five planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) appear in the returned list
- [ ] Each `PlanetPosition` object passes Pydantic validation (no missing required fields)
- [ ] Rise, transit, and set times are ISO 8601 strings or `null` when not applicable
- [ ] Altitude and azimuth values are within physically valid ranges (−90 to 90 and 0 to 360 respectively)

---

## Phase 3: Weather and Utility Integration — ✅

**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Parallelisable with**: Phase 2

### Tasks
- ✅ Already in place — `backend/app/utils/logger.py` copied from norrsken; no changes needed
- ✅ Already in place — `backend/app/utils/sun.py` copied from norrsken; used as-is for daylight penalty
- ✅ Already in place — `backend/app/utils/moon.py` copied and extended: added `get_moon_angular_separation()` function for planet proximity scoring
- ✅ Already in place — `backend/app/services/cache_service.py` copied from norrsken; no changes needed
- ✅ Already in place — `backend/app/services/weather/base.py` copied from norrsken; no changes needed
- ✅ Already in place — `backend/app/services/weather/metno_client.py` copied from norrsken; no changes needed
- ✅ Already in place — `backend/app/services/weather/openmeteo_client.py` copied from norrsken; no changes needed
- ✅ Already in place — `backend/app/models/weather.py` copied from norrsken; no changes needed

### Intended Outcome
All weather service files, utility modules, and the cache service are present and importable. Weather data can be fetched for a lat/lon coordinate and cloud cover retrieved as a numeric value.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] `from backend.app.utils.logger import get_logger` imports without error
- [ ] `from backend.app.utils.sun import get_sun_altitude` imports without error
- [ ] `from backend.app.services.weather.metno_client import MetNoClient` imports without error
- [ ] Weather client returns a cloud cover value (0–100) for lat=55.7, lon=13.4 when called against live API (or a mocked response in tests)
- [ ] Cache service stores and retrieves a value within the same process

---

## Phase 4: Visibility Scoring — ✅

**Depends on**: Phase 2, Phase 3
**Parallelisable with**: Phase 6 (frontend scaffolding can begin)

### Tasks
- Build `backend/app/services/scoring.py` — implement `score_planet(planet: PlanetPosition, sun_altitude: float, cloud_cover: float, moon_phase: float, moon_separation: float) -> int`
- Altitude penalty — zero score below 0°, linearly scaling up to full weight at 30°+
- Apparent magnitude factor — brighter planets (lower magnitude) score higher
- Sun elevation penalty — full penalty when sun is above −6° (civil twilight), partial at −6° to −18°
- Cloud cover penalty — linear reduction; 100% cloud cover zeroes the score
- Atmospheric extinction penalty — increases rapidly below 10° altitude
- Moon proximity penalty — reduce score when moon is within 15° of the planet and phase is above 0.5
- Implement `score_tonight(planets: list[PlanetPosition], ...) -> int` — overall sky summary score (0–100)

### Intended Outcome
Given a list of planet positions plus weather and solar data, the scoring module returns a 0–100 integer score for each planet and an aggregate tonight score. Scores behave sensibly at boundary conditions (planet below horizon = 0, fully overcast = 0, excellent conditions = high score).

### Definition of Done
- [ ] A planet at −1° altitude returns a score of 0
- [ ] A planet at 45° altitude with 0% cloud cover and sun at −20° returns a score above 70
- [ ] 100% cloud cover causes every planet's score to be 0
- [ ] Sun above 0° (daytime) causes every planet's score to be 0
- [ ] Moon penalty reduces score by a detectable amount when moon is within 10° and phase > 0.8
- [ ] `score_tonight` returns a value in the range 0–100

---

## Phase 5: API Layer — ✅

**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Parallelisable with**: none

### Tasks
- ✅ Already in place — `backend/app/api/routes/health.py` copied from norrsken; service name changed to `planeter-api`
- Build `backend/app/api/routes/planets.py` — implement three endpoints:
  - `GET /api/v1/planets/visible?lat=&lon=` — returns currently visible planets with positions and scores
  - `GET /api/v1/planets/tonight?lat=&lon=` — returns all planets with tonight's visibility windows
  - `GET /api/v1/planets/{name}?lat=&lon=` — returns detailed info for a single named planet
- Register the planets router in `backend/app/main.py`
- Add input validation — lat must be −90 to 90, lon must be −180 to 180, planet name must be one of the five valid names
- Return structured error responses (422 for invalid input, 404 for unknown planet name)

### Intended Outcome
All three planet endpoints are reachable and return valid JSON. The `/visible` endpoint integrates planet calculation, weather fetch, and scoring into a single response. Health endpoint still works.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/planets/visible?lat=55.7&lon=13.4` returns HTTP 200 with a JSON array of planet objects
- [ ] Each planet object in the response contains `name`, `altitude`, `azimuth`, `score`, and `rise_time`
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/planets/tonight?lat=55.7&lon=13.4` returns HTTP 200
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/planets/jupiter?lat=55.7&lon=13.4` returns HTTP 200 with a single planet object
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/planets/pluto?lat=55.7&lon=13.4` returns HTTP 404
- [ ] Invalid lat/lon values return HTTP 422 with a descriptive error message
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/health` still returns HTTP 200

---

## Phase 6: Frontend — ✅

**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Parallelisable with**: Phase 4 (scaffolding and static layout can begin before Phase 5 is done)

### Tasks
- ✅ Already in place — `frontend/js/location-manager.js` adapted: storage key changed from `aurora_location` to `planet_location`
- ✅ Already in place — `frontend/js/components/map-selector.js` copied from norrsken; no changes needed
- ✅ Already in place — `frontend/js/components/settings-modal.js` adapted: title changed to "Inställningar", button text in Swedish, aurora-specific fields removed
- ✅ Already in place — `frontend/js/components/tooltip.js` copied from norrsken; no changes needed
- ✅ Already in place — `frontend/css/tokens.css` adapted: primary accent changed to warm gold `#f5c842`, secondary to deep blue `#3b82f6`, aurora-specific metric color renamed
- ✅ Already in place — `frontend/css/base.css` copied from norrsken; no changes needed
- ✅ Already in place — `frontend/css/layout.css` copied from norrsken; no changes needed
- ✅ Already in place — `frontend/css/components/modal.css` copied from norrsken; no changes needed
- Build `frontend/index.html` — dark-themed page layout with planet card grid, sky summary banner, location picker trigger, and settings icon
- Build `frontend/js/api.js` — functions `fetchVisiblePlanets(lat, lon)`, `fetchTonightPlanets(lat, lon)`, `fetchPlanet(name, lat, lon)` calling the planeter API
- Build `frontend/js/components/planet-cards.js` — renders one card per planet showing name (Swedish), altitude, azimuth compass direction, score bar, rise/set times
- Build `frontend/js/components/sky-summary.js` — renders the top-level "tonight's sky" banner with overall score and count of visible planets
- Build `frontend/css/components/planet-cards.css` — dark card style with score colour gradient (red → amber → green)
- Create `start-frontend.sh` — simple static file server for the frontend directory

### Intended Outcome
Opening `index.html` in a browser shows the full planet visibility UI. All five planet cards render with live data from the API. The location map picker works. Labels and planet names are in Swedish.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All five planet cards (Merkurius, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturnus) render in the browser without console errors
- [ ] Each card displays altitude, azimuth direction, and a numeric score
- [ ] Score bar changes colour based on score value (red for low, green for high)
- [ ] Clicking the location button opens the Leaflet map picker
- [ ] Selecting a new location on the map triggers a fresh API fetch and re-renders the cards
- [ ] Sky summary banner shows correct count of planets with score above 50
- [ ] Page is usable on a 375 px wide mobile viewport (no horizontal overflow)
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in the browser console on initial load

---

## Phase 7: Testing — ✅

**Depends on**: Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, Phase 4, Phase 5, Phase 6
**Parallelisable with**: none

### Tasks
- Read existing norrsken test files to understand patterns before writing any tests
- Write unit tests for `calculator.py` — known planet positions at fixed dates and locations
- Write unit tests for `scoring.py` — boundary conditions (below horizon, full cloud, full sun, moon penalty)
- Write integration tests for `GET /api/v1/planets/visible` — valid input, invalid lat/lon, unknown planet name
- Write integration tests for `GET /api/v1/planets/tonight` and `GET /api/v1/planets/{name}`
- Write integration test for `GET /api/v1/health`
- Configure `pytest.ini` or `pyproject.toml` with asyncio mode and test paths

### Intended Outcome
Running `pytest` from the backend directory executes all tests and they pass. Test output is readable and failures identify the specific assertion that broke.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] `pytest` exits with code 0 (all tests pass)
- [ ] Calculator test asserts Jupiter's altitude at a known date/location matches `ephem` reference output within 0.1°
- [ ] Scoring tests cover: altitude below horizon returns 0, cloud 100% returns 0, sun above 0° returns 0
- [ ] API integration test for `/visible` with invalid lat (e.g. lat=999) asserts HTTP 422
- [ ] API integration test for `/planets/pluto` asserts HTTP 404
- [ ] Test suite runs in under 30 seconds (weather calls are mocked)
- [ ] No test imports production secrets or makes real external HTTP calls

---

## Phase 8: Visibility Reason Tooltips — ✅

**Depends on**: Phase 4, Phase 5, Phase 6
**Parallelisable with**: Phase 7

### Tasks
- Extend `backend/app/models/planet.py` — add a `visibility_reasons: list[str]` field to `PlanetData`; reasons are short machine-readable keys, e.g. `"below_horizon"`, `"dagsljus"`, `"molnighet"`, `"månljus"`, `"atmosfärisk_dämpning"`
- Extend `backend/app/services/scoring.py` — collect the active penalty factors during scoring and populate `visibility_reasons` on the returned object; a planet with a zero score should carry at least one reason
- Update `backend/app/api/routes/planets.py` — confirm that `visibility_reasons` is included in all three endpoint responses (`/visible`, `/tonight`, `/{name}`)
- Extend `frontend/js/components/planet-cards.js` — attach a tooltip (via the existing `tooltip.js` component) to the visibility-status text on each planet card; the tooltip content is built from `visibility_reasons` and rendered in Swedish
- Add Swedish reason-label lookup in `frontend/js/utils.js` — map each reason key to a human-readable Swedish string, e.g. `"below_horizon"` → `"Planeten är under horisonten"`, `"dagsljus"` → `"För ljust – solen är uppe"`, `"molnighet"` → `"Molnen blockerar sikten"`, `"månljus"` → `"Månens sken stör observationen"`, `"atmosfärisk_dämpning"` → `"Atmosfärisk dämpning vid låg höjd"`
- Update `frontend/css/components/planet-cards.css` — style the visibility-status text with a dashed underline to signal that it is hoverable

### Intended Outcome
Hovering over the visibility text on any planet card (e.g. "Ej synlig" or "Synlig") opens a small tooltip listing in plain Swedish why the planet is or is not observable. All relevant factors — cloud cover, daylight, moon interference, horizon obstruction, and atmospheric extinction — can appear independently or in combination.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] `PlanetData` includes a non-empty `visibility_reasons` list for every planet whose score is below 100
- [ ] A planet below the horizon always carries the reason `"below_horizon"` and never a positive score
- [ ] A planet hidden by cloud cover carries `"molnighet"` regardless of its altitude or score
- [ ] Hovering the visibility text in the browser shows a tooltip with at least one Swedish-language reason string
- [ ] Multiple simultaneous factors (e.g. low altitude + partial cloud cover) each appear as separate lines in the tooltip
- [ ] Planets with a high score and no active penalties show no tooltip, or the tooltip states "Goda observationsförhållanden"
- [ ] Tooltip is keyboard-accessible (visible on focus) and dismissed on blur or mouse-leave
- [ ] No JavaScript errors are thrown when `visibility_reasons` is an empty array

---

## Phase 9: Scoring Accuracy and Scale Calibration — ✅

**Depends on**: Phase 4, Phase 6
**Parallelisable with**: Phase 10, Phase 11

### Tasks

- **Fix the `is_visible` twilight threshold** in `backend/app/services/scoring.py` `apply_scores()`. Change `sun_altitude < -6` to `sun_altitude < -12` so that `is_visible` requires nautical twilight or darker, matching the specification in ARCHITECTURE.md ("twilight phase is nautical twilight or darker"). The existing inline comment on the `is_visible` condition already labels the threshold "nautical twilight or darker", which is correct for −12°; once the threshold value is fixed to −12, no other comment change is needed.
- **Recalibrate scoring component weights** so the full 0–100 range is reachable. The current components (altitude 0–30, magnitude 0–20, cloud cover 0–30) sum to at most 80. Adjust the positive components to: altitude 0–40, magnitude 0–25, cloud cover 0–35, totalling 100. Update `score_planet()` in `backend/app/services/scoring.py` accordingly. Update the scoring table in `ARCHITECTURE.md` to match.
- **Fix visible-planet count in sky summary** in `frontend/js/components/sky-summary.js`. Change `planets.filter(p => p.is_visible)` to `planets.filter(p => p.visibility_score > 50)` so the count matches the Phase 6 Definition of Done ("planets with score above 50").
- **Update `scoreToLevel` tier boundaries** in `frontend/js/utils.js` if the recalibrated scale shifts where "good" and "excellent" begin. Ensure "excellent" is reachable under realistic best-case conditions (clear sky, planet at 45+ degrees altitude, full darkness).

### Intended Outcome
The visibility score accurately reflects real-world observing conditions for every planet. The full 0–100 scale is reachable: a planet under ideal conditions (clear sky, high altitude, full darkness) scores at least 90. The `is_visible` flag only flips true when it is genuinely dark enough to observe, and the sky summary correctly counts planets with a score above 50. The score is the single most important number the app produces — it drives the `is_visible` flag, the sky summary, the card colours, and the tooltip reasons. The three problems addressed here (twilight threshold, unreachable scale ceiling, wrong visible-count criterion) are corrections to existing modules, not new features; fixing them together ensures the number a user sees genuinely reflects what they would experience outside.

### Definition of Done

- [ ] `apply_scores()` sets `is_visible = False` for a planet when the sun altitude is -8 degrees (between civil and nautical twilight), even if the planet is above the horizon with a positive score
- [ ] `apply_scores()` sets `is_visible = True` for a planet when the sun altitude is -14 degrees (nautical twilight), the planet is at 30 degrees altitude, cloud cover is 0%, and the score exceeds 15
- [ ] A planet at 45 degrees altitude with magnitude −4.0, 0% cloud cover, sun at −20 degrees, and no moon proximity penalty produces a score of 100 (all positive components are at maximum and all penalties are zero)
- [ ] The `scoreToLevel` function returns `"excellent"` for a score of 95
- [ ] The sky summary visible count shows 0 when all five planets have scores between 16 and 50 (previously would have shown them as visible via the `is_visible` flag)
- [ ] The ARCHITECTURE.md scoring table matches the new component weights in `score_planet()`
- [ ] No existing Phase 8 tooltip behaviour is broken — `visibility_reasons` still populates correctly

---

## Phase 10: Backend Cleanup — Dead Code and Redundant Computation — ✅

**Depends on**: Phase 5, Phase 6
**Parallelisable with**: Phase 9, Phase 11

### Tasks

- **Remove the unused `penalty_pts` return value from `calculate_moon_penalty()`** in `backend/app/utils/moon.py`. The scorer computes its own moon proximity penalty via `get_moon_angular_separation()` and never reads `penalty_pts`. Remove the `penalty_pts` computation and drop it from the returned dict. Audit all callers (`scoring.py` `apply_scores()`, `planets.py` `_build_moon_info()`) to confirm none read the field.
- **Eliminate the double sun/moon computation in the `/visible` endpoint** in `backend/app/api/routes/planets.py`. Currently `apply_scores()` calls `calculate_sun_penalty()` and `calculate_moon_penalty()` internally, and then the route handler calls `_build_sun_info()` and `_build_moon_info()` which call the same two functions again. Refactor so the sun and moon data are computed once and passed through. Preferred approach: compute sun/moon data in the route handler first, then pass it into `apply_scores()`, keeping `apply_scores()` a pure scoring function. Apply the same fix to the `/tonight` and `/{name}` endpoints.
- **Mark `fetchTonightPlanets()` as reserved for a future phase** in `frontend/js/api.js`. Add a clear comment on the function explaining that it is not called by the current UI and why — the backend `/tonight` endpoint has sophisticated night-window sampling that the current UI does not yet consume.

### Intended Outcome
The backend has no dead code or duplicate computation. Each request triggers exactly one sun calculation and one moon calculation regardless of which endpoint is called. `frontend/js/api.js` no longer contains a live function that silently calls an endpoint whose results are never used. This phase addresses two kinds of waste inherited from the rapid copy-and-build process: dead code that misleads anyone reading the module, and redundant computation that calls the same `ephem` functions twice per request. Cleaning these up now — before Phase 7 (Testing) writes assertions against the current interfaces — prevents dead code from being enshrined in tests. Note: Phase 10 must be completed before Phase 7 writes its `scoring.py` unit tests, because Phase 10 changes the internal signature of `apply_scores()` and tests written against the old signature would require immediate rework. This phase is refactoring only: no new features, no API changes, no frontend changes.

### Definition of Done

- [ ] `calculate_moon_penalty()` no longer contains a `penalty_pts` key in its returned dict
- [ ] `_build_moon_info()` still constructs a valid `MoonInfo` object after the `penalty_pts` key is removed
- [ ] The `/visible` endpoint makes exactly one call to `calculate_sun_penalty()` and one call to `calculate_moon_penalty()` per request
- [ ] The `/tonight` and `/{name}` endpoints also avoid double computation
- [ ] `fetchTonightPlanets()` in `frontend/js/api.js` carries a clear comment marking it as reserved for a future phase and explaining why it is not called by the current UI
- [ ] All three API endpoints (`/visible`, `/tonight`, `/{name}`) return identical response shapes as before — no fields added, removed, or renamed
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/health` still returns HTTP 200

---

## Phase 11: Frontend Cleanup — Dead CSS and Coordinate Formatting — ✅

**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Parallelisable with**: Phase 9, Phase 10

### Tasks

- **Remove dead norrsken grid selectors from `frontend/css/layout.css`**. Delete the `.score-section`, `.data-grid-section`, and `.chart-section` rules. These selectors targeted norrsken's dashboard layout and have no corresponding elements in planeter's `index.html`. After removing those three rules, audit every remaining rule in the `@media (min-width: 900px)` block by cross-referencing each selector against `frontend/index.html`. Remove any additional rules whose selectors have no corresponding element in the planeter DOM. Leave the `@media` block intact if other rules inside it are still needed; remove the entire block if it becomes empty.
- **Fix `formatLocation()` hemisphere labels** in `frontend/js/utils.js`. Currently the fallback format always appends "N" and "O" regardless of the sign of lat/lon. Change it to append "N"/"S" based on the sign of latitude and "Ö"/"V" (Öst/Väst in Swedish) based on the sign of longitude. Use the absolute value of the coordinate for display so that negative signs do not appear alongside the hemisphere letter.

### Intended Outcome
`frontend/css/layout.css` contains only rules that apply to elements present in planeter's DOM. `formatLocation()` in `frontend/js/utils.js` produces correct hemisphere labels for any coordinate on Earth, not just the positive-lat/positive-lon case that covers Sweden. Two issues carried over from the norrsken copy are resolved: layout CSS targeting selectors that do not exist in planeter's DOM (which adds noise to the stylesheet and would confuse anyone reading the grid layout), and a coordinate formatter that hardcodes Northern and Eastern hemisphere labels (a bug invisible for Sweden but wrong for any location outside the positive-lat/positive-lon quadrant). This phase is cleanup only: no new features, no backend changes.

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Confirm that `index.html` contains no elements with class `score-section`, `data-grid-section`, or `chart-section` before removing the CSS rules (search `frontend/index.html` for these class names)
- [ ] `layout.css` contains no rules targeting `.score-section`, `.data-grid-section`, or `.chart-section`
- [ ] The `@media (min-width: 900px)` block in `layout.css` either contains only planeter-relevant rules or is removed entirely
- [ ] `formatLocation({ lat: 55.7, lon: 13.4 })` returns `"55.70°N, 13.40°Ö"` (unchanged for Swedish positive-coordinate case)

## Confirmed Decisions

| Question | Decision |
|---|---|
| Planet scope | **Naked-eye only**: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn |
| Time selection | **Right now + tonight**: current positions, plus tonight's visibility windows (sunset → sunrise) |
| UI language | **Swedish**: all labels, planet names, and UI text in Swedish |
| Cloud cover | **Affects visibility score**: overcast sky reduces or zeroes a planet's score |
| Default location | Södra Sandby (55.7°N, 13.4°E) — same as norrsken |
| Uranus/Neptune | Not in scope for MVP; can be added in a future phase |

## Future Roadmap

### Phase A: Sky Map
- Interactive sky map showing planet positions on a hemispherical projection
- Use HTML5 Canvas or SVG to render the sky dome
- Show cardinal directions, horizon line, zenith
- Plot planets with size proportional to brightness

### Phase B: Observation Tips
- Best viewing times for each planet (when highest above horizon in darkness)
- "What to look for" descriptions (colour, brightness, nearby stars)
- Telescope vs. binocular vs. naked-eye guidance
- Conjunction and opposition alerts

### Phase C: Extended Bodies
- Add Uranus and Neptune (telescope targets)
- Add bright asteroids (Vesta, Ceres)
- Add comets (when notable ones are active)
- International Space Station pass predictions

### Phase D: Notifications
- Push notifications for rare events (conjunctions, oppositions, Mercury visibility windows)
- "Tonight's highlights" daily summary
